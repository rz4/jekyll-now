I am currently a machine learning engineer working at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. I graduated in 2017 with my 
undergraduate degree in computer science, specialized in machine learning and parallel programming. I also have a strong 
background programming in low level lanaguages, and working with high performance computing (HPC) systems. 

My real interest lies in the field of artificial intelligence. While everyone is hyped up on deep learning, I find
myself still admiring the elegance and naivety of classic A.I. and all of its promises. That being said, I hope that one day 
the two will merge and provide an avenue to the real holy grail of programming: automation of programming itself.
