## Background

I am currently a machine learning engineer working at Lawerence Berkeley National Laboratory. I graduated in 2017 with my 
undergraduate degree in computer science, specializing in ML and parallel programming. I also have a strong 
background in programming in low level lanaguages, and working with high performance computing (HPC) systems. 

My real interest lies in the field of artificial intelligence. While everyone is hyped up on deep learning, I still find
admiring the elegance and naivity of classic A.I. and all of its promises. That being said, I hope that one day 
the two will merge and provide an avenue to the real holy grail of programming: the automation of programming itself.
